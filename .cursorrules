# Socialize Project - Coding Standards and Guidelines

## Code Style and Formatting

### General
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript/TypeScript/React, 4 spaces for PHP/Laravel)
- Limit line length to 100 characters where possible
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all files
- End files with a newline character
- Remove trailing whitespace

### JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend)
- Follow ESLint configuration with Airbnb style guide
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Prefer functional components with hooks in React
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for component names and classes
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### PHP/Laravel (Backend)
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use camelCase for methods and variables
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use snake_case for database fields

## Git Workflow and Commit Standards

### Branch Naming
- feature/feature-name: For new features
- bugfix/bug-description: For bug fixes
- hotfix/issue-description: For critical fixes
- release/version: For release preparation

### Commit Messages
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep descriptions concise and descriptive (max 72 chars)
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Pull Request Process
- PRs must pass all automated tests
- Require at least one code review before merging
- Squash commits when merging to main branch
- Delete branches after merging

## Deployment Practices

### Environments
- Development: Local Docker environment
- Staging: Pre-production environment for testing
- Production: Live environment

### Deployment Process
1. Automated tests must pass in CI pipeline
2. Deploy to staging environment first
3. Perform manual QA on staging
4. Deploy to production during low-traffic periods
5. Monitor application metrics after deployment

### Rollback Procedure
1. Identify the issue requiring rollback
2. Execute rollback command to previous stable version
3. Verify system functionality after rollback
4. Document the incident and resolution

## Security Practices
- No secrets or credentials in code repositories
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
